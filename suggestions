Ideas to discuss:

1. add script for model: which could be a mip model, metaheuristic, etc.
2. create a module that contains data validation only
3. create a datin and datOut classes or functions. it will transform table into data and vice versa for input and output schema
3.1 dat in can also do the validations in order to use the intermediate data create for validation purposes
3.2 or we could create a Validator object that contains those intermediate tables/data
4. main will orchestrate the whole process
5. a decision to be made is where the validations will be called, it could be in main, or in datIn
6. add this workflow information to the README
7. modify write_data to create the folder if it doesn't exit
8. update the __init__ to include deployment configuration (?). or put hose configurations in a separate file,
recall that mip template will be presented/explained in mip way
9. update dev dependencies: include openpyxl.
